## Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

**Data creation** is the systematic **collection of data** for a specific purpose and **digitizing** the data for downstream processing in statistical analysis or sharing with or reuse by others.

## What is the plan?

| Time  | Task  |
|:---|:---|
| 30 min  | Data collection - desing method  |
| 30 min  | Go outside and collect data  |
| 30 min  | Discussion on data collection and digitizing  |




# Data collection

## Data collection methods

- automatic data collection (e.g. weather station, LiCor)

- manual data collection (samples, measure, count)

## Exercise: design method (15 min)

- Make groups of 4-5 students.

- Decide what **data you want to collect**.
(e.g. snow depth, length of icicles, plant height)

- Decide on a **method** to collect the data (e.g. paper, phone).

- **Design a spreadsheet/protocol**. Think about what is the relevant information that you need.

**Reflect** on  the decisions you made and if you would change anything if you had the means.


## Discussion: collect data (10 min)

- What decisions did you make?
- What are the cons and pros of your method?


## Exercise: collect your data (30 min)

- Go outside and collect your data. It is not important to collect as many data points as possible.

- **Reflect** if the method you used was suitable for the data you collected.


## Discussion: data collection (10 min)

- How did it go?

- Was the method appropriate?

- Did you miss any information?



## Key things during data collection

- Logistical issues

- Calibration of instruments

- Multiple measurements/observations/samples

- Template/protocol for sampling (multiple data collectors, over time)

- Take notes during data collection

- Collect meta data that could be useful for wider usage

# Digitizing and process data

## Disscusion: digitizing (15 min)

- What would be your strategy for digitize the data?

- What could be problems?



<!-- Here are some slides at the end if there is time -->

## Data validation tools

Use data validation tools for data entry.

- format cells (dates)

- set ranges

- drop down menu



## Be consistent

- file names

- variable names

- factor levels

- missing data

- notes


## Careful with dates

## Data workflow

- Digitize data

- Keep raw data raw

- No calculations in raw data

- Code-based data cleaning

- Clean data

- Document your data (data about your data)
