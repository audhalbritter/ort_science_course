## Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Data creation is the systematic **collection of data** for a specific purpose and **digitizing** the data for downstream processing in statistical analysis or sharing with or reuse by others.

## What is the plan?

| Time  | Task  |
|:---|:---|
| 20 min  | Design method  |
| 10 min  | Discuss your decisions  |
| 30 min  | Go outside and collect data  |
| 30 min  | Discussion  |




# Data collection

## Exersice: design method (20 min)

- Make groups of 4-5 students.

- Decide what you what **data you want to collect**.
(e.g. snow depth, length of icicles)

- Decide on a **method** to collect the data (e.g. paper, phone).

- **Design a spreadsheet/protocol**. Think about what is the relevant information that you need.

Make notes on the decisions you have taken.

Reflect on if you would use a different method if you had the means.


## Discussion: collect data (10 min)

- What decisions did you make?
- How would you improve the data collection if you could?


## Exersice: collect your data (30 min)

Go outside and collect your data.

It is not important to collect as many data points as possible.

**Reflect** and make notes if the method you used was suitable for the data you collected.



## Key things during data collection (BES guide)

- Logistical issues

- Calibration of instruments

- Multiple measurements/observations/samples

- Template/protocol for sampling (multiple data collectors, over time)

- Take notes during data collection

- Collect meta data that could be useful for wider usage




# Digitizing and process data


## Exercise: digitizing (5 min)

Discuss how you would digitize the data and what to consider during that process.


## Disscusion: the whole process (25 min)

- What was easy
- 



## Data validation tools

Use data validation tools for data entry.

- format cells (dates)

- set ranges

- drop down menu



## Be consistent

- file names

- variable names

- factor levels

- missing data

- notes


## Careful with dates

## Data workflow

- Digitize data

- Keep raw data raw

- No calculations in raw data

- code-based data cleaning

- Clean data

- document your data (data about your data)
